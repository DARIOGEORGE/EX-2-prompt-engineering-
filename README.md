## 1. Introduction to Prompting Patterns

Prompting patterns are structured methodologies for formulating instructions that guide AI models toward desired outputs. These patterns leverage:

- Psychological principles
- Cognitive frameworks
- Empirical observations about how language models process and respond to different types of instructions

### Key Benefits of Structured Prompting:

| Benefit        | Description                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Consistency    | Reproducible results across similar tasks       |
| Clarity        | Reduced ambiguity in model interpretation       |
| Efficiency     | Faster convergence to desired outcomes          |
| Scalability    | Easier to train teams and maintain standards    |
